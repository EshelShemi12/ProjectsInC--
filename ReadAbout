 **interdaction**
 Every C++ program must have a special function named main
 When the program is run, the statements inside of main are 
 executed insequential order.
 
 
 

 
 in C++ we use "int" to call our variable 

like int Eshel;

or this function : 
int age;
cout<< "How old are you ? "; 
cin>> age;
cout "In 10 years you are going to be "<<age+10;



    |The cout Output Statement|


Used to display information on computer screen
It is declared in the header file iostream
Syntax

		cout << expression;

Uses << operator to send information to computer screen
	cout << "Hello, there!";

Can be used to send more than one item
	cout << "Hello, " << "there!";


 |To get multiple lines of output on screen|
       Either
	- Use the endl function
	 		cout << "Hello, there!" << endl;
         Or
	 Use \n in the output string
	 		cout << "Hello, there!\n";
